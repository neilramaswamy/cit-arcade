"""
This project can run in two modes:

1. Python mode, which already has a web server for user-interaction, games, and GIF rendering
2. Interop mode, which exposes primitives to easily paint pixels to the screen from any language

Python mode is the default, and it is what you get when you run `python driver.py`.

Two primitive functions are exposed for interop mode, which are:

    1. initialize-screen, which returns a tuple of the form [num_rows, num_columns]
    2. paint-screen, which takes a 3D matrix of the form [num_rows, num_columns, 3] of RGB pixels

Users using interop mode will have to implement any more complicated features themselves.

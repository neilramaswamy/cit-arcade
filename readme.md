# The CIT Arcade

This project holds the source code for all of the software that powers the 170 square foot display
that can be installed on the face of the CIT.

Documentation and a developer guide are soon to be made public, but here are the coolest features:

- Integration with Pygame, so you can develop games using any Pygame modules you'd like
- Interactivity as a first-class citizen, so you can build games that people can control in real-time via their phones
- A clean API to develop your own bespoke graphics or games
- Interop with Racket (if you don't want to use Python to program)

Some multimedia from the project can be seen [here](https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipOgMuZJ2tKGHjO9bG9c4xqZcxPG5v8TPbP4X1KpGGm-gHoAhOAqC2CflWsHd9m9Tw?key=UVotbWtiMXYwd0lDbHpFSTJtVDRORHJWb0d3ZHBn).
